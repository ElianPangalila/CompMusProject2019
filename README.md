# The Beatles' Discography

My corpus is essentially the entire Beatles's discography as pulled from Spotify, so it is an Album corpus.
As far as describing the corpus goes I'd say it contains some pretty nice music, also it consists of a total of 670 songs
of which 217 are live performances. Additionally, because remastering is a thing album release dates are messed up, which is troubling because my plan so far was to look at the evolution of audio features as a function of time.

## A brief look
Ignoring tracks that have album names that contain the words "Live" or "Remastered", the links below are images of plots
when release dates are plotted against mean tempo and mean instrumentalness. You might notice there are still release dates in the year 2000's: I forgot about compilation albums.

[Date x Mean Instrumentalness](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElianPangalila/CompMusProject2019/master/date_meaninstru_BEATLES.png)

There's a good chance I will try to find different corpus, because so far nothing interesting about the corpus has come up.
