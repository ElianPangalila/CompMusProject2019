# The Beatles' Discography

My corpus is essentially the entire Beatles's discography as pulled from Spotify, so it is an Album corpus.
As far as describing the corpus goes I'd say it contains some pretty nice music, also it consists of a total of 670 songs
of which 217 are live performances. Because of remastering album release dates are messed up, which is troubling because my plan so far was to look at the evolution of audio features as a function of time.
