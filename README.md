# The Beatles' Discography

My corpus is essentially the entire Beatles's discography as pulled from Spotify, so it is an Album corpus.
As far as describing the corpus goes I'd say it contains some pretty nice music, also it consists of a total of 670 songs
of which 217 are live performances. Because of remastering album release dates are messed up, which is troubling because my plan so far was to look at the evolution of audio features as a function of time.

Ignoring tracks that have album names that contain the words "Live" or "Remastered", the below links are images of plots
when release dates are plotted against mean tempo and mean instrumentalness. As you might notice there are still release dates in the year 2000's: I forgot about compilation albums.
